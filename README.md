# Credits

Penny has two elder sisters, [Penny](https://youtu.be/7Py03SH5DbE) and [Penny](https://youtu.be/PiVTC8JhZTQ). Note that I have no hardware contributions, all I did is to gather the information, assemble things and write the firmware. I want this wonderful robot to be easy to clone, therefore I created this repository. The original Penny#1 is created by [Jeremy Zimmer](https://www.robotshop.com/community/robots/show/penny). The wiring being cumbersome and cheapduino being discontinued, Dennis van Elteren has designed the motherboard that I also use. Thus Penny#2 was born. Here I present you Penny#3.
